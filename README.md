# FinPal Receipt-Tracker
The Receipt Tracker Application provides a comprehensive solution for managing both receipts
and expenses, helping users take control of their financial management. By allowing easy scanning
and categorization of paper and digital receipts, the app ensures users can track spending, manage
expenses, and have quick access to all receipts for different purposes such as looking for warranties
and insurance claims. With support for Arabic-language receipts, it fills a critical gap for individuals
and businesses in Saudi Arabia, making receipt management and expense tracking accessible and
efficient.
